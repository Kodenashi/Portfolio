    <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Jancelio Varquez Leopoldo</strong> ‚Äî a passionate and dedicated customer service professional with over 3 years of experience. I specialize in delivering thoughtful, efficient, and human-centered support across various industries including car insurance, health insurance, and tech troubleshooting.</p>

    <p>I believe that great service starts with empathy. Whether I‚Äôm resolving a complex issue or simply listening to someone‚Äôs concern, I strive to ensure that every interaction leaves a positive impact. My background has taught me the value of patience, resilience, and continuous learning.</p>

    <p>Aside from customer service, I‚Äôm also a self-taught coder. I enjoy building websites and exploring the creative side of technology. Coding started as a hobby and has now become one of my favorite ways to challenge myself and grow new skills. I‚Äôve created several personal projects which you can find in the ‚ÄúMy Other Links‚Äù section in the Home Page.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I‚Äôm a proud father, a fan of anime (especially One Piece), and a lifelong learner. I‚Äôm always looking for new opportunities to improve myself, contribute meaningfully, and build a future I can be proud of ‚Äî both professionally and personally.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out. I‚Äôd love to hear from you!</p>
